# MovieHunt Project #
A movie searching website created using React. This website is powered by the TMDb API. This project is not yet a finished product. The purpose of this project is for me to be able to learn more about react and it's uses. As of now this project uses react router, react-slick for the carousels, and react-image-fallback for the default images.
